I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

you picking up the dry-cleaning.

for me to get there.

Yes or no.

Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

202
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,773
No. The Springs was actually the

where he lived and worked,

- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

I think it's a fair example.

Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

624
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,105
Maybe.

625
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,774
Huh? Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

626
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,860
- 30 years.
- That's what they say.

627
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,257
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

628
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,494
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

629
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,829
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

630
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,756
- Okay.
- Okay?

631
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,302
It works.

632
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:15,644
Listen to me, Tony. We're a
team. Do you understand?

633
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,980
There's nothing we can't
do if we stick together,

634
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,482
like your father and I.

635
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,359
I'm sorry I didn't give
you a heads-up, okay?

636
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,985
- But if I had...
- Tony.

637
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,113
Tony, no more of this "ready,
fire, aim" business.

638
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,450
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

639

You gotta let me handle this.

different kind of ball now.

take a lot of heat.

Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

I just need your
help for a sec.

Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

It was. It is now an antique.

This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

663
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,524
I'm swapping it up for
an upgraded unit,

664
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,319
and I just ran into a
little speed bump.

00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,778
Speed bump, what
does that mean?

666
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,197
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

667
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:53,617
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

668
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,828
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

669
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:59,414
It's fine.

670
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:01,416
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

671
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,251
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

672
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:08,340
I want you to reach in, and you're
just gonna gently lift the wire out.

673
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,467
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

674
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,219
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

675
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,637
the socket wall or
it goes "beep."

676
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,880
What do you mean, "Operation"?

677
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,223
It's just a game, never mind.

678
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:20,268
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

679
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,648
You know, I don't think that
I'm qualified to do this.

680
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:28,777
No, you're fine. You're the

'Cause I'm...

683

- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

684
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:39,453
Okay.

685

Oh, there's pus!

686
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:50,215
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

687
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,217
- not from my body.
- It smells!

you pull it out, you don't...

his insight,

that ability to look into a
situation beyond the obvious

- Don't do that.

- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

now or something?

- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

to get your mind right.

- I'm serious.
- Okay.

01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:11,683
you know that I would
help you with anything,

1247

going to start all of this again.

yourself, Tony.

be a part of it.

well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?

I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
