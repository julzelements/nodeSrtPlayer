1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,200
'Sup, guys?

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,300
Wait a minute...

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,400
You guys aren't the real Avengers! I can tell, Hulk gives it away.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,500
That was awesome!

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,600
- Did Liz get a new top?
- No. We've seen that before.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,700
Never with that skirt.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,800
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy though.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,900
Yeah.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,020
Too late.

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,150
You guys are losers.

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,260
So, to become an Avenger, are there like trials or an interview?

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,370
Just don't do anything I would do

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,490
and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,620
There's a little gray area in there and that's where you operate.

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,780
All right?

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,200
That's not a hug, I'm just grabbing the door for you.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,420
Good luck out there.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,630
- Listen, I know school sucks.
- Peter!

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,880
- You still with us?
- Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,080
I know you want to save the world.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,210
You're not ready yet.

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,390
- You're the Spiderman.
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,450
- This is just a costume!
- You were on the ceiling!

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,580
Stay close to the ground.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,660
And stay out of trouble.

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,800
Forget the flying monster guy. There are people who handle this sort of thing.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,120
I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,320
- But you are a kid.
- This is my chance to prove myself.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
Peter, what is going on with you?!

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm really sorry, I'm so busy. I'm slammed.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,900
Don't mess with me, because I'll kill you

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,128
and everybody you love.
